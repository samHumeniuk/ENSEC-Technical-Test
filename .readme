This repo contains code for a C# Web API which can be editted in Visual Studio and creates an endpoint for users to upload to Meter Readings to a database.

The following work has not been completed due to time constraints:

- No real database has been created. An in-memory database in used instead.
- No tests have been written to cover the MeterReadingStorageController. Ideally the MeterReadingHelper would be "mocked" in order to write proper unit tests for the Controller.
- No Migrations files have been created to allow developers to recreate a database from the schema.
- No logging has been done
- No xml documentation has been written
